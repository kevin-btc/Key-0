# React App Documentation

## Introduction

This document serves as technical documentation for the React app. The app is built using React and utilizes the `MyRouts` component to handle the routing of the application.

## Application Overview

The React application consists of a single component, `App`, which is the root component of the application. Within the `App` component, the `MyRouts` component is imported and used to handle the routing of the application.

## Components

### App Component

The `App` component is responsible for rendering the entire application. This component imports the `MyRouts` component and renders it to handle the routing of the application.

### MyRouts Component

The `MyRouts` component is responsible for handling the routing of the application. It is located in the `routers/routes` file and is imported into the `App` component. 

## Conclusion

The React application uses the `App` and `MyRouts` components to handle rendering and routing. Further development of the application can be done by modifying these components or adding new components as needed.
