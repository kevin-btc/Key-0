## Introduction
This document is aimed to provide technical documentation for developers working with the React App. The React App is a frontend web-application that has been created using React Framework.

## File Structure
```

│       └── Login.js
├── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── README.md
```
The above tree represents the file structure of the project. All the source files are kept in the `src` directory.

## `App.js`
This contains the code for the root component of the application. It imports MyRouts, which contains all the theme of the application, and renders it.

## `routers` Directory
This directory consists of all the components where routing happens. The Home.js and Login.js files contain code related to the respective routes.

## Dependencies
This project depends on the following packages:
- React
- React-DOM
- React-Router-DOM

## Conclusion
This is a brief technical documentation for the React App. We hope this documentation helps developers understand the code structure and architecture of the application. Developers can refer to this document in case of any doubts or issues.
