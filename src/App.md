# React App Documentation

This is a basic React application that uses MyRouts module to create routes for the application. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository url]`
2. Go to the application directory: `cd [application directory]`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm start`

## Dependencies

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- MyRouts: A custom module that creates routes for the application.

## File Structure

- `App.js`: The main component that renders MyRouts module.
- `routers/routes.js`: The module that creates routes for the application.

## Usage

- `App.js`:
  - Imports MyRouts: `import MyRouts from "./routers/routes";`
  - Renders MyRouts module: `return <MyRouts />;`
- `routers/routes.js`:
  - Imports necessary libraries: `import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";`
  - Defines routes: 
    ```javascript
    const MyRouts = () => {
        return (
            <Router>
                <Switch>
                    <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
                    <Route exact path="/about" component={About} />
                </Switch>
            </Router>
        );
    };
    ```
## Conclusion

This React application uses MyRouts module to create custom routes for the application. It can be easily extended for more complex applications.
