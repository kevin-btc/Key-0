# Function documentation: add_numbers(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 

The `add_numbers` function accepts two integer arguments and returns their sum. This function is written in Rust programming language. 

## Inputs

- `x: i32`: an integer value
- `y: i32`: an integer value

## Output

- `i32`: the sum of `x` and `y`.

## Usage

```rust
let x = 2;
let y = 3;
let result = add_numbers(x, y);
println!("The result is: {}", result);
``` 

## Example

```rust
fn add_numbers(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
  x + y
}

#[test]
fn test_add_numbers() {
    assert_eq!(add_numbers(2, 3), 5);
    assert_eq!(add_numbers(0, 0), 0);
    assert_eq!(add_numbers(-2, 3), 1);
    assert_eq!(add_numbers(-2, -3), -5);
}
``` 

## Note

Make sure to check and parse the `name` field correctly while using the country data returned in the format shown in the image.

## Introduction

This technical documentation aims to detail the implementation of parsing the country data returned with a focus on ensuring that the `name` field is correctly parsed. Additionally, it provides guidance for swizzling the components to handle RTL languages, although translations are not yet supported in Docusaurus 2.

## Parsing the Country Data

The `fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32` function, as provided by you, is not related to parsing the country data returned. Therefore, the first step in this process is to create an algorithm that accurately parses the `name` field.

The country data returned from the API call takes the format shown in the following image:

[![Country Data Format][1]][1]

The `name` field is a string value that represents the name of the country. To ensure that the `name` field is parsed correctly, it is important to note that the key only represents an integer value.

Refer to the code snippet below as a sample implementation:

```rust
fn parse_country_data(country_data: &serde_json::Value) -> String {
    let mut name_value = String::new();

    if let Some(name) = country_data.get("name") {
        if let Some(name_string) = name.as_str() {
            name_value = name_string.to_string();
        }
    }

    name_value
}
```

The function `parse_country_data` takes a reference to the country data returned from the API call and returns the `name` field as a `String` value. The implementation uses the `serde_json` crate to parse the JSON object and retrieve the `name` field value.


## Swizzling Components for RTL Languages

Docusaurus 2 unfortunately does not support translations at this time, nor does it have specific support for right-to-left (RTL) languages. However, it is possible to swizzle the relevant components to handle RTL languages.

To swizzle components in Docusaurus 2, you can use the `docusaurus-swizzle` command provided by the CLI. You will need to swizzle the relevant components that display text, such as the header and footer components, to support RTL languages. If the content is dynamic, such as the `parse_country_data` implementation provided above, you will need to ensure that the text is aligned to the right of the page.

It is important to note that additional consideration will need to be taken if Docusaurus decides to provide support for translations and RTL languages at a later date. However, for the moment, swizzling components and aligning text to the right will suffice.
