# Documentation for Codebase: sd9qszmurfg

## Introduction
This codebase handles data related to countries, specifically their names, codes and other related details. It also involves swizzling components to handle display in RTL languages.

## Swizzling Components
To handle display in RTL languages, it is necessary to swizzle the components using the `docusaurus-swizzle` command. This functionality has not yet been built into Docusaurus 2, but will be taken into account in future updates.

## Country Data
The country data returned by the codebase has the following format:

```
{
   key: number,
   name: string,
   countryCode: string,
   phoneCode: string,
}
```

When parsing this data, it is important to ensure that the `name` field is correctly parsed along with the `key` field. This is not currently implemented in the codebase.

## Conclusion
This documentation provides insight into the various functions and features of the codebase with reference to swizzling components and formatting country data.

Documentation for b3hsij1sa9n

Introduction:

The b3hsij1sa9n codebase provides functionality for handling the country data in a Docusaurus 2 project. It includes code for handling swizzling of components and parsing of country data retrieved in a specific format.

Swizzling of Components:

To ensure the proper handling of RTL (Right to Left) languages, you would have to swizzle the components. To do this, please refer to the Docusaurus 2 documentation on swizzling components, which can be found at https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/cli/#docusaurus-swizzle.

Parsing of Country Data:

The country data returned has a particular format, which should be correctly parsed to enable the correct display. Please refer to the image below for an example of how the country data is returned

When parsing the data, be sure to include the `name` field along with the key as the integer alone may not be sufficient.

Translation:

Currently, there isn't a way to translate to RTL (Right to Left) languages in the project. However, RTL languages will be taken into account when building the project in the future. 

Conclusion:

The b3hsij1sa9n codebase serves as a valuable resource for handling country data in a Docusaurus 2 project. With the proper handling of components, parsing of country data and future support for RTL languages, the output of the code will be optimized for the best user experience according to the unique requirements of your project.
