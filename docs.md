# Code Documentation

## Introduction 

This is a document detailing the functionality and usage of the code provided. The code handles swizzling components to accommodate for RTL languages. Translation is not yet included in Docusaurus 2, but this code takes into account the RTL languages during development.

### Dependencies

- Docusaurus 2

## Usage

To use this code, you would have to swizzle the components. 

## Data Format

The country data returned by the components follows the below format:

```
{
   "id": 12,
   "name": "Nigeria",
   "flag": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/cWI9H.png"
}
```

Ensure that the `name` field is parsed correctly, as the code only parses the key, which is an integer. 

### Sample Result

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the usage, data format and dependencies of the code.

# Docusaurus Localization Documentation

## Introduction

This guide is intended for developers using Docusaurus 2 and requires the knowledge of React and Markdown. The purpose of this documentation is to guide developers through the process of swizzling the components to handle translations and RTL languages in Docusaurus 2. Unfortunately, we haven't built a way for translations, but we'll take into account RTL languages when we build it. We'll also explain how to correctly parse the country data format.

## Swizzling Components

To handle translations in Docusaurus 2, you need to swizzle the components. "Swizzling" is the process of replacing an existing component with a new one. Swizzling allows you to extend the functionality of an existing component or replace it with a completely custom one. With Docusaurus 2, you can swizzle the header component to display different languages or RTL formats.

To swizzle a component in Docusaurus 2, you can use the [Docusaurus CLI tool](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/cli/#docusaurus-swizzle). It allows you to modify the default components or create new ones from scratch. The following steps outline the process of swizzling the header component in Docusaurus 2:

1. Run this command in your terminal: `npx docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Header`
2. Navigate to the `Header` component file located in the `src/theme` directory.
3. Modify the `Header` component to include the different languages and RTL formats you want to display.

## Parsing Country Data

When working with the country data format shown below, it is important to parse it correctly. Docusaurus 2 only parse the key field as an integer, therefore make sure you also parse the name field correctly.

```json
{
  "1": { "name": "Afghanistan", "code": "AF" },
  "2": { "name": "Albania", "code": "AL" },
  "3": { "name": "Algeria", "code": "DZ" },
  "4": { "name": "American Samoa", "code": "AS" },
  // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

This guide has outlined the process of swizzling components to handle different languages and RTL formats in Docusaurus 2. It has also highlighted the importance of parsing country data correctly. We hope you find this guide helpful in your development process.
