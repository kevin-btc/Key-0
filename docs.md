# Documentation for Handling RTL Language and Parsing Country Data in Docusaurus 2

This documentation provides guidance for swizzling components to handle Right-to-Left (RTL) languages in Docusaurus 2, as well as parsing country data correctly.

## Handling RTL Language

If you need to handle RTL languages in your Docusaurus 2 project, you will have to swizzle the components to incorporate the necessary changes.

To swizzle components, you can use the following command:

```bash
docusaurus swizzle <component-name>
```

Unfortunately, at this time we do not have a built-in way for translations in Docusaurus 2. However, we are considering RTL languages in our development roadmap.

## Parsing Country Data

When parsing country data in Docusaurus 2, it is important to ensure that you are doing so correctly. The country data is returned in the following format:

```
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  code: string
}
```

It is crucial to parse the `name` field correctly, as it contains the actual name of the country. Please note that the `name` field is a string, while the `code` field is an integer.

If you are using the provided code snippet, please ensure that the `name` field is being parsed correctly.

```javascript
// Example code for parsing country data
myCountryData.map((country) => {
  console.log(country.name);
});
```

By following these guidelines, you can handle RTL languages and parse country data correctly in your Docusaurus 2 project. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

## Documentation for Cadjjtz21au Codebase

### Introduction

This documentation aims to provide a clear and concise guide on how to implement RTL (Right-to-Left) language support in Docusaurus 2 using the provided codebase with the key `cadjjtz21au`. The following sections will cover how to swizzle the components, parse the returned country data, and handle translations.

### Swizzling the Components

To handle RTL languages in Docusaurus 2, you would need to swizzle the components. Fortunately, Docusaurus 2 provides an easy-to-use CLI command for swizzling components.

To swizzle a component, open a terminal and navigate to your Docusaurus 2 project directory. Then, use the following command: 

```
docusaurus swizzle <package-name> <component-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` and `<component-name>` with the actual package and component names that you want to swizzle. 

After swizzling, you should customize the swizzled components to support RTL languages.

### Parsing Country Data

The country data returned by the code has the following format:

```
{
  "name": "Afghanistan",
  "iso2": "AF",
  "iso3": "AFG",
  "phone": "93",
  "currency": "AFN",
  "capital": "Kabul",
  "continent": "AS",
  "status": "published"
}
```

Make sure to parse this data correctly. Note that the `name` field should also be parsed, not just the key which is an integer.

### Handling Translations

Unfortunately, Docusaurus 2 does not have built-in support for translations. However, when building a translation system, be sure to take into account RTL languages to ensure proper display of text.

### Conclusion

This concludes the documentation for the `cadjjtz21au` codebase. Keep in mind the information covered in this guide to properly implement RTL language support in Docusaurus 2.
