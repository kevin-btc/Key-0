# Documentation for Code Base 8o1p2dt8utb

## Introduction
This code base is designed to handle RTL (Right-to-Left) languages in Docusaurus 2. Unfortunately, translations are not currently built into Docusaurus 2; however, the team is committed to considering RTL languages in future builds. 

## Components
To handle RTL languages, the components in this code base require swizzling. You can use the Docusaurus CLI to swizzle the components as needed. 

## Country Data
The country data returned by this code base is in a specific format, which is essential to parse correctly for accurate functionality. The data has the following format:

```
{
  "name": "Afghanistan",
  "key": "AFG",
  "phoneCode": "+93",
  "icon": "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡«"
}
```

It is vital to ensure that the `name` field is parsed correctly, as it is not parsed by default. Instead, only the `key`, which is an integer, is parsed. 

For reference, an image of the country data format is provided below:

## Code Documentation

### Overview

This code is designed to handle RTL (right-to-left) languages in Docusaurus 2. Unfortunately, there is not a built-in way to handle translations in Docusaurus 2 yet. However, you can use [swizzle](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/cli/#docusaurus-swizzle) the components to handle this.

### Parsing the Country Data

The country data that is returned has the following format:
```
{
  name: string,
  code: string,
  phone: string,
}
```

You need to parse this data correctly to ensure the correct display of RTL languages. Please note that the `name` field should also be parsed correctly as an RTL language, as we noticed that only the `key` field, which is an integer, is currently being parsed.

Here is a sample of the data format:
```
{
  name: "Ø¥Ø³Ø±Ø§Ø¦ÙŠÙ„",
  code: "il",
  phone: "972",
}
```

It is crucial to parse the `name` field correctly to ensure that it aligns correctly with the rest of the content on the page.

### Swizzling Components

In order to handle RTL languages, you will need to swizzle the existing components. Please use the [swizzle command](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/cli/#docusaurus-swizzle) to make the necessary changes.

### Conclusion

This code has been designed to help handle RTL languages in Docusaurus 2. While there is no built-in way to handle translations yet, swizzling the components will help to ensure that content is displayed accurately for RTL languages.
