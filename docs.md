# Documentation for x1ulsbbm157

The aim of this documentation is to provide instructions on how to implement translation support and handle right-to-left (RTL) languages in Docusaurus 2 using `x1ulsbbm157`.

## Overview

`x1ulsbbm157` is currently lacking translation support and RTL language handling. In this documentation, we will discuss how to address these issues.

## Translation Support

Unfortunately, Docusaurus 2 does not have built-in translation support, but we can use a workaround to add it. We would have to swizzle the components to handle this, which means we would have to modify the components' default code to implement translation support.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install `@docusaurus/theme-classic` if you haven't done so already.
2. Run `docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Translation` to create a new `Translation` component.
3. Open the `Translation.js` file, which should now be in the `/src/theme/Translation/Translation.js` directory.
4. Change the `strings` object to include the translations you want to add in the format `'language code': { 'string key': 'translated string' }`.
5. In your markdown files, you can now use the `Translation` component by including the `Translate` component and passing it the string key.

Here's an example:

```jsx
import Translate from '@docusaurus/Translate';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <p>
      <Translate id="helloWorld">Hello, world!</Translate>
    </p>
  );
}
```

## RTL Language Support

Similarly, `x1ulsbbm157` currently lacks support for RTL languages. However, we can take steps to improve this in the future. For now, we recommend that you swizzle the components and modify their default code to handle RTL languages.

Here's an example of how to do this:

1. Install `@docusaurus/theme-classic` if you haven't done so already.
2. Run `docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic RTL` to create a new `RTL` component.
3. Open the `RTL.js` file, which should now be in the `/src/theme/RTL/RTL.js` directory.
4. In the `RTL` component, add a `dir` attribute to the `html` tag and set its value to `'rtl'`.
5. Use CSS to set the `writing-mode` property of the `body` tag to `vertical-rl`.
6. In your markdown files, use the `RTL` component to wrap your content.

Here's an example:

```jsx
import RTL from '@docusaurus/RTL';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <RTL>
      <p>This content will be displayed in RTL direction.</p>
    </RTL>
  );
}
```

## Parsing Country Data

The `x1ulsbbm157` code returns country data in the format shown in the image below:

It is important to parse this correctly. Please note that the `name` field should be parsed in addition to the key field.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, `x1ulsbbm157` currently lacks translation support and RTL language handling. However, we have provided a workaround to implement these functionalities. Parsing the data returned by `x1ulsbbm157` requires including the `name` field in the parsing. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to consult the relevant documentation or contact the development team.

# Documentation: Handling RTL Languages in Docusaurus 2

## Introduction

This document provides a brief overview of how to handle right-to-left (RTL) languages in Docusaurus 2. Unfortunately, there is currently no built-in way to handle translations in Docusaurus 2. However, we will definitely consider RTL languages when building this functionality.

## Swizzling Components

To handle RTL, you will need to "swizzle" Docusaurus 2 components to modify their behavior. A "swizzle" command provides a way to inspect and modify the codebase of a Docusaurus 2 project.

Once you have identified the components that need to be swizzled, you can then modify them to handle RTL language support.

## Formatting Country Data

The country data returned by your code is in a specific format, as shown below:

```
{
  key: 1,
  name: 'United States',
  code: 'USA',
  phone: '1',
  currency: 'USD',
  native: 'en-US',
  emoji: 'ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸',
  continent: 'NA',
  capital: 'Washington D.C.',
  languages: ['en']
}
```

It is essential to parse this data correctly, ensuring that the `name` field is included, not just the `key` field which is an integer.

## Conclusion

Handling RTL languages in Docusaurus 2 requires some modification of the components. While there is currently no built-in way to handle translations in Docusaurus 2, it is possible to modify the components to enable RTL support. In addition, it is essential to correctly parse any data that will be displayed in your Docusaurus 2 project, to ensure that it is displayed correctly.

Handling RTL languages in Docusaurus 2

Introduction:

Docusaurus 2 is a modern static website generator that makes it easy to build documentation websites. Itâ€™s built on top of React and provides support for customizability, performance, and ease of use.

Unfortunately, Docusaurus 2 doesn't have support for RTL languages out of the box. However, it is possible to handle RTL languages in Docusaurus 2 by following a few steps. This document outlines the steps required to do so.

Swizzling components:

To handle RTL languages in Docusaurus 2, you would have to swizzle the components to support RTL. This is a two-step process.

Step 1 - Swizzling the components:

The first step is to swizzle the components that require RTL support. This is done using the Docusaurus swizzle command. The Docusaurus swizzle command is located in the Docusaurus CLI. Here's how to use the command to swizzle components:

```
npx docusaurus swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Translation
```

After running this command, you'll see that the swizzled component files have been added to your site's `src/theme/` directory.

Step 2 - Updating the theme configuration:

The second step is to update the configuration of the swizzled components. This is done by adding the following configuration blocks to the themeConfig object in the `docusaurus.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  themeConfig: {
    // ...
    locales: {
      '/': {
        // ...
      },
      '/ar/': {
        direction: 'rtl',
        // ...
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
};
```

This code block should be added to the configuration file for the swizzled component that you want to add RTL support to.

Handling country data:

The country data that's returned has a specific format. You need to parse this correctly to ensure that you're capturing all the required fields. Here's an example of the country data format:

Note that the `name` field needs to be parsed correctly, along with the `key` field.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, adding RTL languages support in Docusaurus 2 is a two-step process. You will have to swizzle the components and update the theme configuration. Additionally, country data needs to be parsed correctly to ensure that all fields are captured. Although it's unfortunate that Docusaurus 2 doesn't provide built-in support for translations at this time, it's reassuring to know that RTL languages are being taken into account for future updates.
