# Documentation for qakz3gew0q Code

This documentation details the code implementation for the `qakz3gew0q` component in [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). The component is designed to handle RTL languages, but unfortunately, translations have not been implemented in Docusaurus 2 yet. 

## Usage

To use this component, it is necessary to swizzle the existing components. You can refer to the [Docusaurus CLI documentation](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/cli/#docusaurus-swizzle) for more information on how to do this.

## Country Data

The component retrieves country data in the following format:

```
{
   code: 'AD',
   name: 'Andorra',
   phone: '376',
   currency: 'EUR'
}
```

It is important to note that the `name` field must be parsed in addition to the key, to ensure that the data is properly processed. 

## Conclusion

With these guidelines, you should be able to effectively use the `qakz3gew0q` component in your Docusaurus 2 project. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please refer to the [Docusaurus 2 documentation](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/).

## Technical Documentation for Swizzling Components

In order to handle right-to-left (RTL) languages in Docusaurus 2, you would need to swizzle the components. Unfortunately, the platform does not yet support translations, but RTL languages will be taken into account in future updates.

To properly parse country data returned in the following format:

```
{
  "1": {
    "name": "Afghanistan",
    "code": "AF"
  },
  "2": {
    "name": "Albania",
    "code": "AL"
  },
  ...
}
```

It is important to note that the `name` field must be correctly parsed along with the integer key.

Before implementing swizzling, ensure that your preferred integration method has been successfully configured. For details on the correct swizzling process, refer to the official Docusaurus 2 documentation.

For more information on swizzling and Docusaurus 2 components, see the following resources:

- [Docusaurus Swizzling](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/cli/#docusaurus-swizzle) 
- [Docusaurus 2 Components](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/components-overview/) 

We hope this documentation has been clear and concise. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
