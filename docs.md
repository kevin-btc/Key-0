## Documentation for Swizzling Components for Handling RTL Languages in Docusaurus 2

This documentation aims to provide a clear and concise guide for swizzling components to handle RTL (right-to-left) languages in Docusaurus 2.

### Introduction

Docusaurus is a modern and easy-to-use documentation generator that allows developers to create beautiful and user-friendly websites. However, currently, there is no built-in way to handle translations into RTL languages. Nevertheless, this documentation will walk you through the process of swizzling components to handle RTL languages in Docusaurus.

### Swizzling Components

Swizzling is a process of replacing a component with a new one that has the same name but different behavior. In Docusaurus, swizzling allows developers to replace existing components with custom ones.

To swizzle components, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Docusaurus project directory and open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to swizzle components:

    ```
    docusaurus swizzle <component-name>
    ```

    Replace `<component-name>` with the name of the component you want to swizzle.

3. Create a new component that handles RTL languages.

4. Import the new component into your project and use it instead of the default one.

### Parsing Country Data

The country data returned in Docusaurus 2 has the following format:

```
{
    "name": "Afghanistan",
    "alpha2Code": "AF",
    "alpha3Code": "AFG",
    "callingCodes": [
        "93"
    ],
    "capital": "Kabul",
    ...
}
```

Make sure you correctly parse the `name` field, as well as any other fields you need, in your code. It is important to note that the `name` field is a string, while other fields may be arrays or objects.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, swizzling components is an effective way to handle RTL languages in Docusaurus 2, despite the current lack of built-in support for translations into RTL languages. Additionally, when parsing country data, it is important to correctly parse all relevant fields, especially the `name` field, to ensure accurate data.
