Sure, here's an example of how you can document this function in Markdown:

```
### `add_numbers(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32`

This function adds together two integers and returns the result.

#### Parameters

- `x` - the first integer to add
- `y` - the second integer to add

#### Return Value

This function returns an integer that represents the sum of the two parameters.

#### Example

```rust
let result = add_numbers(4, 5);
assert_eq!(result, 9);
```

#### Code

```rust
fn add_numbers(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```

### Additional Information

- This function does not check for overflow or underflow, so be sure to handle those cases if they are a concern in your use case.
```

I hope this helps you create documentation that is clear and easy to understand for other developers. Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with.
