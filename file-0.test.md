Sure! Here's some technical documentation for the `add_numbers` function:

# Function `add_numbers`

- **Purpose**: This function is used to add two integer values `x` and `y`, and return the sum of these values.

- **Parameters**:
  - `x`: an integer value to be added.
  - `y`: an integer value to be added.

- **Return**: An integer value representing the sum of `x` and `y`.

- **Example Usage**:
```rust
let a = 5;
let b = 7;
let sum = add_numbers(a, b);
```

This function takes in two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and adds them together to produce the sum of the two values, which is then returned as an integer. The function can be used by passing in two integer values as arguments, and the resulting sum will be returned.

**Note:** The function assumes that both `x` and `y` are valid integers that can be added without overflowing the `i32` type.
