# Function: add_numbers

The `add_numbers` function takes two arguments `x` and `y` both of type `i32` and returns the sum of the two integers.

## Arguments

- `x` : an integer of type `i32`
- `y` : an integer of type `i32`

## Returns

- An integer that is the sum of `x` and `y`

## Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    let sum = add_numbers(x, y);
    println!("The sum of {} and {} is {}", x, y, sum);
}

// Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
```

The `add_numbers` functions adds the two integers `x` and `y` and returns their sum. In the example shown above, the function is called with arguments `x = 5` and `y = 10`, and the resulting sum is printed to the console.

Note: The function code also includes three random strings of characters `c9vboimxm65`, `6v4qnzfsnus`, and `hnzrqwmv2x5`. These do not have any significance to the `add_numbers` function, hence can be removed from the code.
