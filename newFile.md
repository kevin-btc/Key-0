## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the test code, along with a detailed description and usage instructions for the `App` component.

## Installation

The `test` code is written in React and can be installed using Node Package Manager (npm). To install, run the following command:

```
npm install test
```

## Usage

To use the `App` component, import it into your React application and add it to the component hierarchy.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import MyRouts from "./routers/routes";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyRouts />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Component Details

### App Component

The `App` component is the root component of the test code. It is responsible for rendering the `MyRouts` component.

#### Props

The `App` component has no props.

#### Example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import MyRouts from "./routers/routes";

function App() {
  return <MyRouts />;
}

export default App;
```

### MyRouts Component

The `MyRouts` component is a child component of the `App` component. It is responsible for defining all the routes of the application using the React Router library.

#### Props

  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    </Switch>
  );
}

export default MyRouts;
```

## Conclusion

This documentation provides the necessary information for developers to understand the `test` code and its usage in a React application. The `App` and `MyRouts` components are at the core of the application and should be used as a starting point to build out more complex functionality.
