### MyRouts
The `MyRouts` component is responsible for routing the different pages in the 'test' application.

#### Code
```
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Page1 from "../pages/Page1";
import Page2 from "../pages/Page2";

function MyRouts() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route exact path="/">
        <Page1 />
      </Route>
      <Route exact path="/page2" component={Page2} />
    </Router>
  );
}
```

### Page1
